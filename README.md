### NN Learners' Space 2023 solutions
This repository is dedicated to assisting learners by providing a comprehensive understanding of Neural Networks (NN) while promoting independence from high-level libraries like Tensorflow. Instead of relying solely on these libraries, which sometimes obscure fundamental concepts within their sequential modules, this repository aims to elucidate the varying levels of abstraction involved in programming Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs).

Moving up the abstraction ladder, programmers encounter frameworks and libraries like Tensorflow, PyTorch, or Keras, which streamline NN implementation by providing pre-defined layers and operations. While convenient, these libraries sometimes obscure the underlying mechanics that dictate how neural networks truly function. so let's be more oriented towards algorithm rather than predefined libraries for better understanding.
