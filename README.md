### Neural network using pytorch and tensorflow
This repository is having implementation of ANNs via pytorch and tensorflow libraries, for pizza and not_pizza classification we have pytorch_ann_classifier.py as the code file and for churn modelling the python notebook file has been used.

Moving up the abstraction ladder, programmers encounter frameworks and libraries like Tensorflow, PyTorch, or Keras, which streamline NN implementation by providing pre-defined layers and operations. While convenient, these libraries sometimes obscure the underlying mechanics that dictate how neural networks truly function. so let's be more oriented towards algorithm rather than predefined libraries for better understanding.
